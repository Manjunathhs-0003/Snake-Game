<h1>Snake Game</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository to your local machine:</li>
</ol>
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Snake-Game.git
</pre>

<ol start="2">
  <li>Navigate to the project directory:</li>
</ol>
<pre>
cd Snake-Game
</pre>

<ol start="3">
  <li>Run the game:</li>
</ol>
<pre>
python main.py
</pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Upon running the game, control the snake's movement using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right). The snake will grow longer each time it eats food. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body to continue playing. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.</p>

<h2>High Score</h2>
<p>The game has functionality to store the previous high score locally on the player's machine. This allows players to track their progress and aim to beat their previous best score.</p>
